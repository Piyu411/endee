**Mission Command** is a high-speed, 100% offline Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system built specifically to help aspirants navigate the complex eligibility and syllabus requirements for the Indian Military Academy (IMA) and Combined Defence Services (CDS) examinations.

Built as part of the **Endee.io Recruitment Drive**, this project demonstrates how to deploy a privacy-first AI architecture that requires zero external API keys and keeps all tactical data strictly on the local machine.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

* **100% Offline Architecture:** Powered entirely by local models. No internet connection is required for inference, ensuring absolute data privacy.
* **Universal Intelligence Loader:** Dynamically ingest any number of PDF documents (notifications, syllabi) dropped into the `data/` folder.
* **High-Speed Tactical Retrieval:** Utilizes **FAISS** (Facebook AI Similarity Search) and the **Endee Vector Database** for sub-millisecond semantic search.
* **Persistent Memory:** Employs Streamlit caching and local index saving to ensure rapid boot times after the initial vectorization.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Framework:** Streamlit
* **Local Engine:** Ollama (Llama 3.2)
* **Embeddings:** HuggingFace (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`)
* **Vector Store:** Endee Vector DB & FAISS-CPU
* **Orchestration:** LangChain

---

## ⚙️ Installation & Deployment

To deploy this tactical assistant on your local machine, follow these steps:

### 1. Initialize the Local Brain (Ollama)
Download and install [Ollama](https://ollama.com/). Then, open your terminal and pull the required lightweight model:
```bash
ollama run llama3.2

# Endee: Open-Source Vector Database for AI Search

**Endee** is a high-performance open-source vector database built for AI search and retrieval workloads. It is designed for teams building **RAG pipelines**, **semantic search**, **hybrid search**, recommendation systems, and filtered vector retrieval APIs that need production-oriented performance and control.

Endee combines vector search with filtering, sparse retrieval support, backup workflows, and deployment flexibility across local builds and Docker-based environments. The project is implemented in C++ and optimized for modern CPU targets, including AVX2, AVX512, NEON, and SVE2.

If you want the fastest path to evaluate Endee locally, start with the [Getting Started guide](./docs/getting-started.md) or the hosted docs at [docs.endee.io](https://docs.endee.io/quick-start).

## Why Endee

- Built as a dedicated vector database for AI applications, search systems, and retrieval-heavy workloads.
- Supports dense vector retrieval plus sparse search capabilities for hybrid search use cases.
- Includes payload filtering for metadata-aware retrieval and application-specific query logic.
- Ships with operational features already documented in this repo, including backup flows and runtime observability.
- Offers flexible deployment paths: local scripts, manual builds, Docker images, and prebuilt registry images.

## Getting Started

The full installation, build, Docker, runtime, and authentication instructions are in [docs/getting-started.md](./docs/getting-started.md).

Fastest local path:

```bash
chmod +x ./install.sh ./run.sh
./install.sh --release --avx2
./run.sh
```

The server listens on port `8080`. For detailed setup paths, supported operating systems, CPU optimization flags, Docker usage, and authentication examples, use:

- [Getting Started](./docs/getting-started.md)
- [Hosted Quick Start Docs](https://docs.endee.io/quick-start)

## Use Cases

### RAG and AI Retrieval

Use Endee as the retrieval layer for question answering, chat assistants, copilots, and other RAG applications that need fast vector search with metadata-aware filtering.

### Agentic AI and AI Agent Memory

Use Endee as the long-term memory and context retrieval layer for AI agents built with frameworks like LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, and LlamaIndex. Store and retrieve past observations, tool outputs, conversation history, and domain knowledge mid-execution with low-latency filtered vector search, so your autonomous agents get the right context without stalling their reasoning loop.

### Semantic Search

Build semantic search experiences for documents, products, support content, and knowledge bases using vector similarity search instead of exact keyword-only matching.

### Hybrid Search

Combine dense retrieval, sparse vectors, and filtering to improve relevance for search workflows where both semantic understanding and term-level precision matter.

### Recommendations and Matching

Support recommendation, similarity matching, and nearest-neighbor retrieval workflows across text, embeddings, and other high-dimensional representations.

## Features

- **Vector search** for AI retrieval and semantic similarity workloads.
- **Hybrid retrieval support** with sparse vector capabilities documented in [docs/sparse.md](./docs/sparse.md).
- **Payload filtering** for structured retrieval logic documented in [docs/filter.md](./docs/filter.md).
- **Backup APIs and flows** documented in [docs/backup-system.md](./docs/backup-system.md).
- **Operational logging and instrumentation** documented in [docs/logs.md](./docs/logs.md) and [docs/mdbx-instrumentation.md](./docs/mdbx-instrumentation.md).
- **CPU-targeted builds** for AVX2, AVX512, NEON, and SVE2 deployments.
- **Docker deployment options** for local and server environments.

## API and Clients

Endee exposes an HTTP API for managing indexes and serving retrieval workloads. The current repo documentation and examples focus on running the server directly and calling its API endpoints.
